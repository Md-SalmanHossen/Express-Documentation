It looks like you’re breaking down your learning approach topic by topic, which is great for mastering each concept! Let’s expand on the outline you’ve started, making sure it’s easy to understand and follow.

### **1.1. HTTP Methods**
HTTP methods are the foundation of how clients (e.g., browsers) communicate with servers. You need to understand what each method does and when to use them.

- **GET**:  
  - **Purpose**: Retrieve data from the server.  
  - **Example**: When you open a webpage, your browser sends a `GET` request to fetch the HTML, images, or other data.  
  - **Use Case**: Fetch a list of users from `/users` or get details of a single user from `/users/:id`.  

- **POST**:  
  - **Purpose**: Send data to the server to create a new resource.  
  - **Example**: Submitting a form that adds a new user to a database.  
  - **Use Case**: Create a new user at `/users`.  

- **PUT**:  
  - **Purpose**: Update an existing resource on the server.  
  - **Example**: Sending updated user data to replace the existing data for that user.  
  - **Use Case**: Update user information at `/users/:id`.  

- **DELETE**:  
  - **Purpose**: Remove a resource from the server.  
  - **Example**: Deleting a user from a database.  
  - **Use Case**: Delete a user at `/users/:id`.

### **1.2. Basic Routing**
In Express.js, routing refers to defining the endpoints that respond to HTTP requests. This section is crucial for understanding how to map incoming requests to the correct logic.

- **Defining Routes**:  
  - **Purpose**: Creating routes allows your app to respond to different URLs or paths.  
  - **Example**:  
    ```javascript
    app.get('/users', (req, res) => {
      res.send('List of users');
    });
    ```  
    This route listens for `GET` requests at `/users` and responds with "List of users."
  
- **Route Parameters**:  
  - **Purpose**: Use dynamic segments in routes to capture values, such as user IDs.  
  - **Example**:  
    ```javascript
    app.get('/users/:id', (req, res) => {
      const userId = req.params.id;  // Captures the dynamic value from the URL
      res.send(`User ID is ${userId}`);
    });
    ```  
    This allows you to handle requests like `/users/123`, where `123` is captured as the `id`.
  
- **Query Parameters**:  
  - **Purpose**: Handle optional parameters passed in the query string (e.g., `?name=John`).
  - **Example**:  
    ```javascript
    app.get('/search', (req, res) => {
      const searchTerm = req.query.q;  // Access query parameter 'q'
      res.send(`You searched for ${searchTerm}`);
    });
    ```  
    This handles requests like `/search?q=John`, where `q` is the query parameter.
